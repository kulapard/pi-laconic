# laconic-help

Quick-reference card. One shot, no mode change.

## What it does

Prints a cheat sheet of all laconic modes, sibling skills, deactivation
triggers, and how mode persists: it is stored as a session entry (survives
`/reload`), and since v0.4.3 it is also saved per project in
`.pi/laconic-mode.json` (a new session in the same project directory restores
the last mode). No config file? Falls back to `off`. One-shot display — does not
flip the active mode, write flag files, or persist anything. Use when you forget
the slash commands.

## How to invoke

```
/laconic-help
```

Also triggers on "laconic help", "what laconic commands", "how do I use laconic".

## Example output

```
Modes:
  /laconic              medium (default)
  /laconic low          lighter
  /laconic high         extreme

Skills:
  /laconic-compress     compress memory files
  /laconic-help         this reference

Deactivate:
  "stop laconic" or "normal mode"
```
