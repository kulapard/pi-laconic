# Laconic Help

Display this reference card when invoked. One-shot — do NOT change mode, write flag files, or persist anything. Output in laconic style.

## Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Low** | `/laconic low` | Drop filler and hedging. Keep full sentences and articles. |
| **Medium** | `/laconic` (default) | Drop articles, filler, pleasantries, and hedging. Fragments OK. Default. |
| **High** | `/laconic high` | Extreme compression. Bare fragments. Abbreviate prose words; arrows (X → Y). |

Mode sticks until changed or session end.

## Skills

| Skill | Trigger | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **laconic-commit** | `/laconic-commit` | Terse commit messages. Conventional Commits. ≤50 char subject. |
| **laconic-review** | `/laconic-review` | One-line PR comments: `L42: bug: user null. Add guard.` |
| **laconic-compress** | `/laconic-compress <file> [--force]` | Compress .md files to laconic prose. Saves ~46% input tokens. `--force` overwrites stale backup. |
| **laconic-help** | `/laconic-help` | This card. |

## Deactivate

Say "stop laconic" or "normal mode". Resume anytime with `/laconic`.

## Language

Keep user's language by default. User write Portuguese → reply Portuguese laconic. Compress the style, not the language. Technical terms, code, commands, commit types, and exact error strings stay verbatim unless user ask for translation.

## Mode persistence

Mode set per session entry, so it survives `/reload`. Since v0.4.3 it is also
saved per project in `.pi/laconic-mode.json`; a new session in the same project
directory restores the last mode. Session entry overrides project default. No
config file? Falls back to `off`.

`/laconic` (no argument) = `medium`. Pick another with `/laconic high`,
`/laconic low`, etc. Say "stop laconic" or "normal mode" to turn off.
