A [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) terse-output extension
inspired by [caveman](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman). It makes the agent
answer like a Spartan — compressed, laconic prose (drop articles, filler, and
hedging; fragments over sentences) that cuts output tokens by roughly 65–75%
**while keeping medium technical accuracy**: code, commands, API names, file paths,
and exact error strings are always preserved verbatim.

pi-laconic ships as a Pi package: a single extension (`extensions/laconic.ts`)
plus a set of skills under `skills/`.

> **Note:** the 65–75% token-savings figure is a model-driven estimate, not a
> tracked meter. Pi does not expose per-turn token counts, so `/laconic-stats`
> estimates on demand rather than reading a log.

## Why "laconic"?

*Laconic* comes from Laconia, the region of ancient Sparta. Spartans were
renowned for saying the most with the fewest words — a style so distinctive the
word for it bears their name.

The textbook example: Philip II of Macedon warned Sparta, "If I invade Laconia,
I will raze your city to the ground." The Spartans answered with a single word —
**"If."** Philip never invaded.

That is the whole idea. `pi-laconic` makes your agent answer like a Spartan: medium
meaning, no wasted words. Code, commands, and exact strings stay verbatim — only
the fluff is cut.

## Before / after

<table>

<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Normal

> In Python, if you modify a list while iterating over it with a `for` loop, you can skip elements or get unexpected results because the iterator's index shifts when items are removed. Instead, iterate over a copy of the list using `list(items)` or a list comprehension, then modify the original list afterward.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### `/laconic`

> Don't mutate list while iterating. Index shifts → skipped items. Iterate copy: `for item in list(items):`. Or use list comprehension.

### Normal

> To reduce your Docker image size, use a multi-stage build. Start with a builder stage that compiles your application, then copy only the compiled artifacts into a smaller runtime image based on Alpine or Distroless. For example, `FROM node:20 AS builder`, then `COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist` in the final stage.

### `/laconic`

> Multi-stage build → smaller image. Compile in `node:20 AS builder`. Copy artifacts to runtime image: `COPY --from=builder /app/dist /app/dist`.

Same fix, fewer tokens. Code, commands, and exact strings stay verbatim.

Laconic preserves your language — it compresses style, not the underlying tongue.
Portuguese, Spanish, French, or any other language stays in its own words.

## Mode variants

One scenario, three intensities.

> **Prompt:** Why does my Python script fail with `UnboundLocalError`?

<table>
<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### `/laconic low`

You assigned a value to a variable inside a function after referencing it. In Python, any assignment in a function makes the variable local to that scope. To modify a variable from the outer scope, declare it with `nonlocal` or `global`, or pass it as an argument.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### `/laconic medium`

Assignment inside function makes variable local. `UnboundLocalError` means outer var referenced before assignment. Use `nonlocal` for enclosing scope, `global` for module scope.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### `/laconic high`

Inner assignment → local var. `UnboundLocalError` = outer ref before local assignment. Use `nonlocal`/`global`.

## Install

pi-laconic is published to npm as
[`pi-laconic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-laconic).
Install it into a Pi setup with:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-laconic
```

You can also load it straight from a checkout on disk — see the `pi -e`
mechanism below.

### Install from GitHub

The simplest way to load the latest version directly from the repository is:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/kulapard/pi-laconic
```

Pi resolves the `pi` block in `package.json` and loads both the extension and
all skills from the cloned directory.

### Load the extension directly (per-session)

For quick testing without installing, use Pi's `-e` flag for a single session:

```bash
pi -e /path/to/pi-laconic/extensions/laconic.ts --skill /path/to/pi-laconic/skills
```

(Run from a clone of this repo, substituting its absolute path.)

### Load via the package manifest

The repo's `package.json` carries a `pi` block so Pi can resolve the extension
and skills from the package directory:

```json
"pi": {
  "extensions": ["./extensions/laconic.ts"],
  "skills": ["./skills"]
}
```

Pi resolves `pi.extensions` relative to the package directory, so the extension
loads at its current path (no move into `.pi/extensions/` is needed). Point Pi at
the package directory with `pi install /path/to/pi-laconic` if you prefer a
persistent install over a per-session `pi -e`.

### First-time setup (for development)

```bash
npm install            # fetch the Pi SDK + TypeScript dev deps
npm test               # typecheck + extension/manifest/docs unit tests
```

## Quick start

After installing, type `/laconic` in any Pi session. The statusline shows
`laconic:medium`. Say "normal mode" or run `/laconic off` to turn it off.

## Modes

Three intensity modes (default **medium**). A mode sticks until you change it or the
session ends.

| Mode | Command | Effect |
|------|---------|--------|
| **low** | `/laconic low` | Drop filler. Keep sentence structure. |
| **medium** | `/laconic` (default) | Drop articles, filler, pleasantries, hedging. Fragments OK. Default. |
| **high** | `/laconic high` | Extreme compression. Bare fragments. Abbreviate prose words; arrows (X → Y). |

`/laconic off` disables terse mode.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/laconic [mode\|off]` | Enable a mode for this session (or turn it off). |
| `/laconic-help` | Show the quick-reference card. |
| `/laconic-commit [notes]` | Generate a terse Conventional Commit message. Does **not** commit. |
| `/laconic-review [scope]` | One-line-per-finding code review comments. |
| `/laconic-compress <file> [--force]` | Compress a prose file via the laconic-compress skill. `--force` overwrites an existing `.original` backup. |
| `/laconic-stats` | Load the stats skill (an on-demand, model-driven estimate). |

## Command examples

Generate a commit message:

```bash
/laconic-commit add JWT guard to login route
```

Review a PR scope:

```bash
/laconic-review src/middleware/auth.ts
```

## Natural-language activation

You don't have to use a slash command. The extension watches your messages and
switches mode on phrases like:

- **Activate:** "laconic mode", "talk like a Spartan", "be laconic", "use
  laconic", "less tokens", "fewer tokens", "save tokens", "be brief" → enables
  **medium** mode.
- **Deactivate:** "stop laconic", "normal mode", "disable laconic" → turns it
  off.

## Session and project-scoped behavior

Mode state is stored as a session entry, so it survives a `/reload` within the
same session. It is also persisted per project in `.pi/laconic-mode.json`, so a
**new session in the same project directory** restores the last used mode. A
session entry always overrides the project default, and a project without a state
file falls back to `off`.

## Statusline indicator

When a UI is attached, the statusline shows the active mode as
`laconic:<mode>` (for example `laconic:high`). When laconic is off the indicator is cleared.

## Compression

The `laconic-compress` skill is invoked via the `/laconic-compress` command. It
is prompt-only: the Pi agent itself compresses a prose memory file in place
(writing a `FILE.original.<ext>` backup) using its own model and file tools,
preserving code, URLs, and paths verbatim. No Python and no external Claude CLI
are involved — compression is performed by the host Pi agent, the same way the
other skills work.
